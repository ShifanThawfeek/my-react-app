# My React Learning Journey

This project is a simple React app built while following a Udemy React course. Below are the key concepts and lessons learned so far.

## Overview of the Project
This project renders a simple message on the screen: "Hello React Guys!".

## Key Concepts Learned

### 1. React Basics
- **JSX**: JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript that looks similar to HTML but allows us to write UI components in React.
- **Functional Components**: React components can be written as functions. The `App` component is a functional component that returns a simple `h1` tag.
- **Rendering with `ReactDOM`**: Learned how to render React components using `ReactDOM.createRoot()` in React 18.
- **Strict Mode**: The `React.StrictMode` wrapper is used to highlight potential problems in the app, helping to write safer React code in development.

### 2. Using Git and GitHub
- **Initializing a Git repository**: Learned how to initialize a local Git repo using `git init`.
- **Pushing to GitHub**: Learned how to push code to a GitHub repository, set up an upstream branch, and handle authentication issues using a Personal Access Token.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
